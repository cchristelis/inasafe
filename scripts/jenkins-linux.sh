# You can use this script as the 'execute shell' in a jenkins job.
# For example, set the 'command' contents to this to run the safe package tests:
#
# #!/bin/bash
# scripts/jenkins-linux.sh
#
# Note that since you are fetching the script from Git that you want jenkins
# to run, you will have to build at least once (and probably it will fail)
# before the script is available on the jenkins server for it to be run.
